Hey folks!

I’m excited to share that this custom project is now finished — a full rework of the five Core Set investigators, along with a complete support set to reinforce early archetypes from the Core through The Forgotten Age.

The set includes:
    •    116 new cards total
    •    5 investigators, each with unique signature cards
    •    8 level 0 and 8 upgraded cards for each class
    •    12 neutral cards
    •    3 basic weaknesses

Feedback on balance is especially welcome as I’d love to fine-tune this further with community input.
